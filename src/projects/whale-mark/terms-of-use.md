# Terms of Use

## Subscription services

This service is a subscription-based paid service, which means you will be charged in advance for future subscription use. Currently, you can choose to use the service on a monthly or yearly basis. At the end of each subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew by default, unless you cancel the automatic renewal yourself or we cancel the service. The same Apple ID can only activate the subscription service for Whale Mark once.

## Refund

Subscription fees for the current period cannot be refunded. Please be sure to cancel the service before the end of the subscription period.

## Unsubscribe

If you need to cancel the renewal, please cancel at least 24 hours in advance. You can cancel by the following methods: Open System Settings - Click Apple ID - Click Subscribe - Select Whale Mark Member and cancel the subscription.
