# Terms of Use

## Subscription Service

The service is paid on a subscription basis, which means that you will be paid in advance for future subscription use. Currently you can choose to use the service on a monthly and yearly basis. At the end of each subscription period, your subscription will renew automatically by default, unless you cancel the auto-renewal or we cancel the service. Fox Price Memo can only have one subscription with the same Apple ID.

## Refund

Current subscription fees are non-refundable. Be sure to cancel your service before the end of the subscription period.

## Unsubscribe

To cancel the renewal, please cancel at least 24 hours in advance. You can cancel by following methods: Open system Settings - click Apple ID - Click Subscribe - select Fox Price Memo and cancel the subscription.

## Resumption of purchase

If during the payment process, you receive the prompt "You are currently subscribed to this item" and confirm that the purchase has been completed before, you can click "resume purchase" in the upper right corner to restore.

## Right of Use Sharing
